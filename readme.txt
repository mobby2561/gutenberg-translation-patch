== Description ==

Patch the missing translation strings code on Gutenberg file gutenberg.php

I tried to inform "The Gutenberg Team" about this problem, several times, but nothing happened,
so I decided to publish this patch on my GitHub and send it to the plugin directory for approval.

Now all the polyglots can translate these strings "separately" according to their local language without restrictions!
