# Gutenberg Translation Patch

Patch the missing translation strings code on Gutenberg file gutenberg.php

I tried to inform "The Gutenberg Team" about this problem, several times, but nothing happened.

Because the plugin directory don't generally accept "patch as plugin" and not for translations I decided to publish this patch only on my GitHub.

Now all the polyglots can translate these strings "separately" according to their local language without restrictions!

I have add the gutenberg-translation-patch.txt file that it can be used with PoEdit to generate the local translation for your language.

Some translations was add on distribution file, and more others are coming soon.
